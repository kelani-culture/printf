Specifier.c - will contain the implementations of functions for handling each of the supported conversion specifiers in the _printf function. These functions will be responsible for formatting the corresponding argument based on the specifier and writing it to stdout using the write function.


specifier_1.c - contain some more formatting type function


Main.h - contain all header files


printf.c - printf.c is the file that will contain the implementation of the _printf function. This function will take a format string and variable arguments, format them according to the format string, and write the resulting string to stdout using the write function.
In addition to the _printf function, printf.c may also contain helper functions to assist in formatting and writing the output


Handle_format - The Handle_format.c file is responsible for printing the formatted output to the standard output (stdout) stream. It takes in a format string and a variable number of arguments, and uses the format string to determine how to format and print the arguments.


test - contain the file for testing the printf
