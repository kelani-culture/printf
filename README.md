Specifier.c - will contain the implementations of functions for handling each of the supported conversion specifiers in the _printf function. These functions will be responsible for formatting the corresponding argument based on the specifier and writing it to stdout using the write function.

Main.h - contain all header files

printf.c - printf.c is the file that will contain the implementation of the _printf function. This function will take a format string and variable arguments, format them according to the format string, and write the resulting string to stdout using the write function.
In addition to the _printf function, printf.c may also contain helper functions to assist in formatting and writing the output

test - contain the file for testing the printf
